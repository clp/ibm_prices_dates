# ibm_prices_dates

Dan, I worked on converting strings to dates for plotting prices, and I was successful by looking at your previous scripts. 
However, I have a few questions:
1. What is the purpose of prices1_df.columms ?
2. Did I need to name the columns with a different name than "Date" and "Adj Close".  I used "date_s" and "price" ?
3. I commented out the line "set_index".  What is the purpose of this line ?
